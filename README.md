## About The Project

Stocky allows you to view the price of stocks listed on US and Canadian Stock Exchanges in real-time. The bot gives daily graphs, info, daily numbers and more for any stock desired, all through simple easy-to-use commands!

### Developed Using
This project was developed using the Yahoo! Finance API and the Discord.py module.
* [Yahoo! Finance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)
* [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## Demos

## Getting Started

To use this bot, some packages need to be installed, download these packages from your terminal
```sh
pip3 install discord.py
pip3 install yfinance==0.1.62
pip3 install plotly
pip3 install kaleido
```
For best results when graphing, install the [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) font.

Then clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Momin-C/Stocky.git
```

Setup the bot by watching this [video](https://youtu.be/Uibz0iQjoC0?t=692), remember to create a ClientID.txt file including the client ID retrieved from the discord website. Once that is done run the Stocky.py and the bot will be active.
