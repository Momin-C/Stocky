<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project draws the connection between computer science research and encryption by obtaining a user input and using one of the most secure encryption methods (RSA) to encrypt the given input. The code is explained in the [Roadmap](#roadmap) section of the code and uses many packages, methods, loops, conditional statements, user input and output. This program enables the user to safely send messages to anyone and the end user can decrypt this using this program's built in decryption as well.

<!-- DEVELOPED USING -->
### Developed Using
This project was developed using the Atom text editor and was tested using Terminal.

<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage

To use this file and test its encryption simply clone the CS-ISU repository onto your computer and run it using an IDE or a compiler of your choice.

NOTE: When running the program, it sometimes takes a while for it to ask for an input due to the large prime numbers being generated. If this is the case re-run the program until it asks for you to input a phrase to decrypt instantly.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Momin-C/RSA-Encryption.git
```
